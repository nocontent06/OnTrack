# Welcome to OnTrack - A rail planner Website/App 

OnTrack is build with ReactJS using the HAFAS (HaCon Fahrplan Auskunftssystem) REST API 
Sources are: ~~[v6.db.transport.rest](https://v6.db.transport.rest)~~ [oebb.macistry.com/api](https://oebb.macistry.com)

The Website on witch it runs... or should run... is [ontrack.macistry.com](https://ontrack.macistry.com)

## What makes OnTrack special in comparison to other Rail Planners?

- OnTrack provides results in just a few seconds (Depending on the distance it's often milliseconds too)
- OnTrack covers entire Europe... other Railplanners don't work properly in other countries (OEBB Scotty e.g. is quite slow when it comes to other countries)
- OnTrack is open source
- ...yeah...this was basically everything...
- Ah yeah... developed by a 17 y/o Austrian Citizen :P
